&nbsp;

SwayamSewak is a blockchain-based self-help group platform that aims to empower individuals to come together and support each other towards achieving their financial goals. The platform enables anyone to form a self-help group (SHG) and invite others to join or create their own SHG in a secure environment.

Members of the SHG can also request a small loan without collateral, and all members will vote on whether to lend to them. Loans are made from the SHG's balance, and borrowers must repay the loan within a specified period with a small interest rate. After the loan repayment deadline, all the borrower repays the loan and become trustworthy for future.

With SwayamSewak, individuals can access financial support from a community of trusted peers in a secure, transparent, and decentralized way. The platform aims to foster a sense of collaboration and mutual support among its members, creating a more inclusive and empowering financial ecosystem.
